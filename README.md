Summary of the Vehicle Rental Application
The application is a console-based vehicle rental system designed to allow users to rent cars and bikes from various locations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key features:

User Management: The system allows multiple users to register and rent vehicles. Each user has a unique ID, email, and mobile number.

Vehicle Inventory: The application maintains an inventory of vehicles divided into cars and bikes. Each vehicle has details such as licence plate, model, engine type, and availability status.

Reservation Process:

Users can select the type of vehicle they wish to rent (car or bike).
For car rentals, users specify the number of seats they need, and the application checks for available cars that meet their criteria.
Users can choose from available engine options for cars and can rent bikes from the inventory.
Billing Calculation: After selecting a vehicle, users can make a reservation by providing a start time. The application calculates the total bill based on the rental duration, with different rates for cars and bikes.

Reservation Management: The system tracks reservations, including the vehicle rented, rental start and end times, and the associated costs.

Use Case
For example, a user named "billu" can log in, choose to rent a car, specify that he needs a car with five seats, select from available vehicles, and complete the rental by entering the start and end times for billing. The application will calculate the total cost of the rental and provide a summary of the transaction.

This application is ideal for rental services looking to manage vehicle availability and streamline the rental process, ensuring users have a seamless experience when renting vehicles.
